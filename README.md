# Homework exercise 3 - Describing a one-stock system
This markdown file contains the description of a one-stock system I've chosen.

## Rabbit population dynamics
The system I am now going to explain, regards to a rabbit population (the stock) which is influenced by the birth of new baby rabbits and death of elder one's. The variables are the births and deaths, because they can differ over time. The system of the population consists of two loops: 
1. Reinforcing loop of birth
2. Balancing loop of deaths

A reinforcing loop refers to the fact that the output of one loop, acts as an input for the next loop. In this case, the increase of births, will result in a growth in the population size. Furthermore, a balancing loop counters change caused by one loop, by making change in the opposite direction. The balancing loop encounters the number of births, by death rate, acting as a buffer. So, if a certain rabbit population grows or dies, depends on which loop is dominant. If the reinforcing loop is dominant, a growth will occur. Additionally, if the balancing loop dominates, a decline of individuals within the rabbit population will occur.
